# Calibre-Serve

A [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) API manager and server.

Opens the Calibre library as read-only; this is a module for *reading* the library only, the purpose being to serve a or several libraries from a directory that is synced with a local copy of Calibre.

Has an integrated epub reader thanks to [epub.js](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js/)

## Stand-Alone Usage:

If you want to use it as a stand-alone server:

```sh
npm install -g calibre-serve
```

Then:
```
calibre-serve /path/to/calibre/database
```

the path should be **one directory above** your actual database directory. That is, if `metadata.db` is situated at `/path/to/calibre/database/metadata.db`, then you should use `/path/to/calibre`. Calibre-server will take care of reading sub-directories and adding all the ones that have a `metadata.db`. If no directory is provided, calibre-serve will default to the current directory.

You can use `calibre-serve -h` for help about using options such as port or setting the server's title.

There is very basic protection for books by using the `--tokens` option, which will require the user to provide a token in the url to download.

this is how the default templates look:

Live: [books.xananax.com](http://books.xananax.com)

The default templates are very simple HTML and CSS with no fancyness and should work in any browser, including mobiles of all sorts.

Only the ebook reader uses javascript, and does not work with IE. 

----

## Node API

To use it in another module:

```sh
npm install --save calibre-serve
```
Then:

```js
const calibreAPI = require('calibre-serve');
const path = 'path/to/calibre'
const databases = ['database'];

calibreAPI(path,databases,function(err,LIB){
	if(err){throw err;}
	const defaultLogger = makeManager.defaultLogger; // or anything that has `log` and `error`
	LIB.debug(true); //to get debug output
	LIB.logger(defaultLogger) // to set the logger. DefaultLogger is console.
	//then:
	LIB.getBook('database',8).then(rows=>console.log(rows))
	LIB.getSeries('database',1).then(rows=>console.log(rows))
	LIB.getAuthor('database',9).then(rows=>console.log(rows))
	LIB.getTag('database',33).then(rows=>console.log(rows))
})

```

## Methods:


### calibreAPI

```js
calibreAPI(path:string,databases:string[],nodeBack:(err?:Error,LIB:Manager))=>void
```

returns a manager. A manager has four main methods: `getBook`, `getSeries`, `getAuthor`, and `getTag`. All methods work the same:

`method(databaseName[,locator]) => Promise`

 - `databaseName` is one of the databases passed as a second argument.
 - `locator` is either a numeric id (exact match), a string (will try to match with `LIKE %locator%`), or nothing (all results will be returned)


### calibreAPI.makeServer

```js
calibreAPI.makeServer(path:string,databases:string[],nodeBack(err?:Error,LIB:manager))=>void
```

Returns a manager, augmented with an additional method `getRequestHandler` which returns a request handler.

```
const server = calibreAPI.makeServer(/*...*/);
const requestHandler = server.getRequestHandler(options:{});
// requestHandler is a regular connect handler with signature
// (res,req,next)
```

Possible options are:
 - `options.mountPoint`: required,string. The root point for all URLS in templates.
 - `options.static`: required, string. The static path to prepend to image requests.
 - `options.databases`: required, array. An array of database in the form of `{name,path,description}`. The only important value is `path`, and it should match one of the paths in your `directories` array.
 - `options.onErrorNext`:boolean. If true, the server will yield errors to `next()` instead of handling errors itself.
 - `options.asJson`: boolean. If true, no templates will be used and database output will be sent as is.
 - `options.title`: string. The server title.
 - `options.templates`: An object of templates (`{list,book,author,tag,series,error}`). Each template has the signature: `(rows,locator,command,dbName,options)` where:
 	- `rows` is the returned output
 	- `locator` is the locator argument
 	- `command` is one of `book`, `author`, `series`, or `tag`
 	- `dbName` is the name of the currently used database
 	- `options` is the options object

If you use that, you should set a static server to allow the Calibre server to request images. This would go something like:

```js

const calibreAPI = require('calibre-serve');
const makeServer = calibreAPI.makeServer;

const root = '/path/to/calibre';
const directories = ['database'];
const databases = [{name:'My Database',path:'database',description:'a very nice database'}]
const staticPath = '/covers';
const mountPoint = '/calibre/'
const options = {
	, static:staticPath
	, databases:databases
	, mountPoint:mountPoint
	, title:'My Server'
}
makeServer(root,directories,function(err,LIB){
	if(err){throw err;}
	const requestHandler = LIB.getRequestHandler(options);
	app.use(staticPath,express.static(root))
	app.use(mountPoint,requestHandler);
	app.listen(3000,function(){
		console.log(`listening!`);
	})
})
```

### calibreAPI.connect

```
calibreAPI.connect(options)
```

A nicer API for the above `makeServer`;

```js
const calibreAPI = require('calibre-serve');
const connect = calibreAPI.connect;

connect(
	{ root
	, databases
	, static
	, mountPoint
	, title
	}
,	function(err,requestHandler){
		if(err){throw err;}

		app.use(static,express.static(root))
		app.use(requestHandler);
		app.listen(3000,function(){
			console.log(`${title} listening on ${port}`);
		})
	}
)
```

## Tests

None yet. Coming up.

## Contributions

Oh please yes. Just do the classic fork commit pr dance.

## FAQ

### Is it stable?

No. It's very fresh and might change

### Is it reliable?

No. It doesn't have any test

### Is it fast?

No. The SQL requests are absolutely not optimized. This is intended for private usage, like sharing books with family and friends
